# 3X-UI — RBAC Fork (admin6501)

A customized fork of [MHSanaei/3X-UI](https://github.com/MHSanaei/3x-ui) — an advanced, open-source web panel for managing [Xray-core](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core) servers — extended with a built-in **multi-admin RBAC system**, **reseller scoping**, and a **fully offline installer** for air-gapped or restricted servers.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is intended for personal use only. Please do not use it for illegal purposes or in a production environment.

## What this fork adds

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** — manage multiple panel administrators from the **Admins** page, each with one of four roles:
  - `super_admin` — full access to everything (the first/default admin).
  - `manager` — manage inbounds & clients; **no** panel settings, Xray template, or admin management.
  - `reseller` — scoped to assigned inbounds only; manages their own clients and **views** their inbounds read-only (cannot add / edit / enable-disable / delete inbounds).
  - `readonly` — can view everything but cannot perform any write action.
- **Audit log** — every admin action (create / update / delete admin, password reset, …) is recorded with actor, target, and timestamp.
- **Offline install bundle** — install on a server with no internet using a self-contained tarball (panel binary + Xray-core + geo data). See [`offline/`](offline/).
- **Fork-aware updater** — the panel's "check for update" reads releases from this fork (`admin6501/3x-ui`).
- **PostgreSQL-safe migration** — SQLite → PostgreSQL migration copies all RBAC data (admins, roles, allowed inbounds, audit logs).

## Reseller traffic allocation

Give each **reseller** a total traffic budget and let the panel enforce it automatically:

- Set a per-reseller **traffic quota** (in GB) on the **Admins** page — `0` means unlimited.
- Usage is measured as the **combined up + download of all inbounds assigned to that reseller**.
- When a reseller reaches their quota, the traffic job **auto-disables all of their assigned inbounds**, instantly cutting off their clients.
- Inbounds disabled this way are tracked and **re-enabled automatically** once you raise or reset the reseller's quota.
- **Over-selling is allowed** — only real consumption counts — and each reseller sees their own usage vs. quota on the Reseller dashboard.

## Core features (from 3X-UI)

- **Multi-protocol inbounds** — VLESS, VMess, Trojan, Shadowsocks, WireGuard, Hysteria2, HTTP, SOCKS (Mixed), Dokodemo-door / Tunnel, and TUN.
- **Modern transports & security** — TCP (Raw), mKCP, WebSocket, gRPC, HTTPUpgrade, and XHTTP, secured with TLS, XTLS, and REALITY.
- **Per-client management** — traffic quotas, expiry dates, IP limits, live online status, share links, QR codes, and subscriptions.
- **Multi-node support**, outbound & routing (WARP, custom rules, load balancers, proxy chaining).
- **Built-in subscription server** with [custom page templates](docs/custom-subscription-templates.md).
- **Telegram bot**, **RESTful API** with in-panel Swagger, **SQLite or PostgreSQL**, **13 UI languages**, dark/light themes, and **Fail2ban** IP-limit enforcement.

## Panel features & options (this fork)

Beyond the basics above, the panel also includes:

- **Plans / Packages** — reusable client templates: prefill traffic, expiry and IP limit in one click.
- **Client Groups** — bundle several inbounds so a single client subscription delivers multiple configs.
- **Hosts** — publish custom subscription endpoints (address, port, remark, SNI) per inbound.
- **Editable inbound protocol** — switch an existing inbound to another protocol; its clients are carried over (email, traffic quota, expiry, subscription id) and only their credentials are rebuilt, after a warning that previously shared links stop working.
- **Subscription Remark Template** — build client link names from `{{VAR}}` tokens (`EMAIL`, `INBOUND`, `TRAFFIC_LEFT`, `DAYS_LEFT`, `HOST`, …); clearing the field restores the default template.
- **Extra subscription formats** — JSON and Clash outputs (with optional routing rules) alongside the base64 subscription.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA / TOTP)** for admin logins.
- **LDAP / Active Directory login** — authenticate panel admins against a directory.
- **Email (SMTP) notifications** — event-based alerts with STARTTLS/TLS and a test-email button.
- **External traffic webhook** — push client traffic events to an external URL.
- **MTProto (Telegram) proxy** support via the bundled `mtg` sidecar.
- **Jalali (Persian) / Gregorian calendar** toggle for all dates.
- **In-panel Tutorials page** (super_admin only) — a multilingual quick-start guide to every panel section.
- **Device (HWID) limit** — cap how many devices may fetch a client's subscription, using the `x-hwid` header Happ/Hiddify-style apps send. Panel-wide default plus a per-client override, a device list you can clear, and an optional strict mode that refuses apps sending no device id.
- **Delete expired clients** — clear the ended clients of a single inbound from its row menu, or let the panel sweep them automatically a configurable number of days after they expire (off by default; `0` days never deletes).
- **Subscription page branding** — build the page your users open in a browser from the panel: brand name, tagline, logo, announcement, colours, background, visible sections, support/Telegram/website buttons and custom CSS, with a live preview.
- **Telegram shop — wallet & pay-as-you-go** — the bot sells configs to end users on a prepaid wallet. A user tops the wallet up (minimum and maximum per request are yours to set), optionally has to join a channel first, then creates a config with whatever traffic cap they like on the inbound you choose. **They are charged for what they actually consume**: set the price per GB in the panel, and if they buy 10 GB and use 1 GB, only one gigabyte's worth leaves their wallet. An optional daily fee per config covers time-based pricing. Metering runs every couple of minutes; when a wallet empties that user's configs switch off, and they come back the moment it is topped up. Every movement of money is written to a ledger, so a balance can always be explained. The **Telegram Shop** page shows wallets, top-up requests, configs and their live cost, and can credit or debit a wallet by hand.
- **Custom roles** — build your own roles on the **Admins** page: name one, tick the permissions it should carry (view/manage inbounds, clients, plans, groups, hosts, nodes, panel settings, Xray config, admin management), and assign it like any built-in role. Tick *restrict to assigned inbounds* to make it behave as a reseller, quotas included. A role still held by an admin cannot be deleted.
- **Reseller dashboard** — resellers land on their own dashboard after logging in: quota bars for traffic and client slots, client counts by state (active, online, expiring, ended), a per-inbound breakdown, the clients expiring inside the next week, and the most recently created ones.
- **Disabling an admin takes their inbounds down** — switching a reseller account off also switches off the inbounds assigned to it, so their customers stop connecting, not just the reseller's own login. Re-enabling restores exactly what was taken down and never touches an inbound you disabled by hand.
- **Hardened security** — CSRF protection, security headers, and configurable session lifetime.

## Quick Start (online)

```bash
bash <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/admin6501/3x-ui/main/install.sh)
```

A random username, password, and web base path are generated during install. Run `x-ui` afterwards to open the management menu (start/stop, reset credentials, manage SSL, etc.).

## Offline install (no internet)

For servers with no internet access — or where the GitHub download is blocked:

1. Copy `offline/x-ui-linux-amd64.tar.gz` and `install_offline.sh` to the server (any folder).
2. Run:

```bash
chmod +x install_offline.sh
sudo ./install_offline.sh                 # auto-detects the .tar.gz in the current dir
# or pass it explicitly:
sudo ./install_offline.sh /root/x-ui-linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

It makes **zero network calls** for the bundle (binary + Xray + geo all come from the tarball), prints the generated credentials **and the API token**, and on upgrade **preserves your existing `/etc/x-ui/x-ui.db`** while running migrations (including the RBAC tables). See [`offline/README.md`](offline/README.md) for details.

> The prebuilt offline bundle is **amd64 / x86_64 only**. For other architectures, build a bundle for that arch from source.

## Supported platforms

**Operating systems:** Ubuntu, Debian, Armbian, Fedora, CentOS, RHEL, AlmaLinux, Rocky Linux, Oracle Linux, Amazon Linux, Arch, Manjaro, openSUSE, Alpine, and Windows.

**Architectures:** `amd64` · `arm64` (aarch64) · `armv7` · `armv6` · `386` · `s390x`.

## Database

- **SQLite** (default) — a single file at `/etc/x-ui/x-ui.db`. Zero setup, ideal for small/medium deployments.
- **PostgreSQL** — recommended for high client counts or multi-node setups.

Migrate an existing SQLite install to PostgreSQL (all RBAC data included):

```bash
x-ui migrate-db --dsn "postgres://xui:password@127.0.0.1:5432/xui?sslmode=disable"
# then set XUI_DB_TYPE and XUI_DB_DSN in /etc/default/x-ui and restart:
systemctl restart x-ui
```

The source SQLite file is left untouched; remove it once you have verified the new backend.
